### Troubleshooting

MyNote is currently in development. Meaning certain parts of the app can break after an update (database schemes changes, config...).

If you encounter any hiccups when starting the app or during use, you can reset MyNote by following these steps:

- Go to your home folder directory
    - Windows: `%AppData%\mynote`
    - OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/mynote`
    - Linux: `~/.config/mynote/` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mynote`

- Delete:
    -
    - `IndexedDB` folder
    - `config.json` file

- Restart MyNote

If you still encounter problems after that, you're are more than welcome to open an issue :|)

### Contribute

- Fork and clone
- Master is usually unstable, checkout to a tag to have a stable state of the app

- Install the latest version of electron either by running `npm install -g electron` or downloading the latest release available [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) and just drop the app on `resources/` folder.
- You can use electron now with `electron [electronapp-dir]` command if you installed electron using npm or by running your downloaded electron.

- `npm install && npm run dev` then run in a separate terminal `electron .`
- `npm run dev` will watch for file changes using Webpack which will recompile Vue files.

- Enable dev mode in the app in the settings view to show DevTools

Please respect a few rules:

- Open an issue first to discuss about any major fixes or hacks.
- Make the code readable and comment where possible.
- Make sure `npm run lint` passes. So we can avoid any unnecessary errors.
